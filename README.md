# Hook FltMgr Major Function
This project aims to monitor file write requests throughout Windows using the __Hooking__ technique to intercept the Major Function __IRP_MJ_WRITE__ of the __FltMgr__ driver.

Please, if you want to test this driver on your machine, use a virtual machine with Windows 10 to avoid any potential issues.
